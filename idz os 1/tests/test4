8 Days a Week
(The Beatles)

Ooh, I need your love, babe,
Guess you know it's true.
Hope you need my love, babe,
Just like I need you.

Hold me, love me, hold me, love me,
Ain't got nothin' but love, babe,
8 days a week.

Love you every day, girl,
Always on my mind.
One thing I can say, girl,
Love you all the time.

Hold me, love me, hold me, love me,
Ain't got nothin' but love, babe,
8 days a week.

8 days a week,
I love you.
8 days a week,
Is not enough to show I care.

Ooh, I need your love, babe,

Just like I need you.

Hold me, love me, hold me, love me,
Ain't got nothin' but love, babe,
8 days a week.

8 days a week,
I love you.

Always on my mind.

Love you all the time.

Hold me, love me, hold me, love me,
Ain't got nothin' but love, babe,
